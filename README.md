# Exercise: Wildcards with Generics in a Library Management System

## Objective

Create a library management system that uses generics and wildcards to manage different types of media (books,
magazines, etc.). This exercise will help you understand how to use wildcards to handle collections of different types
in a flexible way.

## Problem

Write a Java program that:

1. Defines a Media class and subclasses Book and Magazine.
2. Uses generics and wildcards to manage a collection of media items in a library.

3. Implements methods to add items to the library, print details of all items, print title list, and find items by a
   specific attribute.

## Steps

1. Define the Media class and its subclasses Book and Magazine.
2. Create a Library class to manage the collection of media items.

3. Implement methods to add items, print details, and find items using wildcards.

Demonstrate the functionality in a Main class.
